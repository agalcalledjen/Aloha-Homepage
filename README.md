  <nav>
    <article>
      <section>
        <aside>
          <footer></footer>
        </aside>
      </section>
    </article>
  </nav>
</header>
```

#### **`<head></head>`**

- `<meta>`: use for responsive design
- `<link></link>`: links external css files and CDNs
  - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - [Flickity CSS CDN](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/#cdn)
- `<script></script>`: links external js files and CDNs
  - [jQuery CDN from Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery)
  - [Flickity JavaScript CDN](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/#cdn)

#### **`<body></body>`**

Font files and put declaration at top of css page to use it throughout.

- [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/)
  ```css
  @font-face {
  }
  ```

Media queries (start with mobile-first and modify for larger widths).

```css
@meda screen and (min-width: 1240px) {
}
```

#### **`<header></header>`**

Use .container for header and footer of page.

- `<nav></nav>`
  - `<ul></ul>`
    - `<li></li>`

Order can be used to create various layouts for media queries.

```css
order: #;
```

#### **`<section></section>`**

Flexbox assists with creating easy to code layouts.

- `<div></div>`
- `<h1></h1>... <h6></h6>`
- `<p></p>`
- `<em></em>`
- `<figure></figure>`
  - `<img>`
  - `<figcaption></figcaption>`
- `<form></form>`
  - `<input></input>`

##### `<section class="new-collection"></section>`

```css
background-image: linear-gradient(), url();
```

##### `<section class="about"></section>`

- justify-content
- align-items
- text-align

##### `<section class="shop"></section>`

- Should have used the following flex properties for the items, one class for the wide items and a second class for the smaller items.
  ```css
  flex-grow: ;
  flex-shrink: ;
  flex-basis: ;
  /* shorthand */
  flex: flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis;
  ```

##### `<section class="featured"></section>`

- jQuery plugin: [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/)

##### `<section class="newsletter"></section>`

- Created a button using `<input></input>`.
- js was applied to div of input.
  - css box-shadow would appear when input type="email" was clicked.
- js was added to submit input.

#### **`<footer></footer>`**

Displaying none hides an element.

```css
display: none;
```
